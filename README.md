# Simultaneous prediction of hand gestures, handedness, and hand keypoints using thermal images

## Abstract
Hand gesture detection is a well-explored area in computer vision with applications in various forms of Human-Computer Interactions. In this work, we propose a technique for simultaneous hand gesture classification, handedness detection, and hand keypoints localization using thermal data captured by an infrared camera. Our method uses a novel deep multi-task learning architecture that includes shared encoder-decoder layers followed by three branches dedicated for each mentioned task. We performed extensive experimental validation of our model on an in-house dataset consisting of 24 users' data. The results confirm higher than 98% accuracy for gesture classification, handedness detection, and fingertips localization, and more than 91% accuracy for wrist points localization.

## ***Dataset***
Data captured with Viento-G thermal camera. We use background subtraction to detect binary hand regions, k-means clustering to isolate each hand, crop the image to tightly include each hand region, and resize it to a 100x100 pixel image.
